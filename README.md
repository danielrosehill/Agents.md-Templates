# Agents.md Templates

[![OpenAI Codex](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenAI-Codex-412991?logo=openai&logoColor=white)](https://openai.com)

This repository contains a collection of `AGENTS.md` templates following the standard suggested by OpenAI for providing rules and context to AI agent codecs. These templates serve as a foundational seeding system for new repositories.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

1. **Centralize agent rules**: Gather together standardized `AGENTS.md` templates for different project types
2. **Enable quick project setup**: Provide a seeding system where you can select an appropriate template and inject it into a new repository
3. **Maintain consistency**: Ensure consistent agent behavior across different projects by using proven rule sets
4. **Scale over time**: Continuously add new templates as different project patterns emerge

## Template Index

| Template | Directory | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Home Assistant Dashboard | [`ha-dashboard/`](./ha-dashboard/) | Rules for iterating on Home Assistant dashboard configurations with version control |

## Template Structure

Each template directory contains:
- `AGENTS.md` - The main agent rules and context file
- Any additional supporting files specific to that project type
