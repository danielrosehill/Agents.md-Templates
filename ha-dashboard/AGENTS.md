# Project Context

The purpose of this repository is iterating upon a Home Assistant Dashboard.

Here's the workflow you should adhere to:

- The user creates versions of this dashboard and uses a numbering system to track versions. Ie, v1.yaml, v2.yaml 
- The user will provide a task outlining the improvements/changes he wishes to make to the dashboard 
- Upon receiving this dask  you should do the following: draft the next iteration with the next iterative number. Then: move the previous iteration into the old-versions folder. If that folder doesn't exist, create it at the base of the repo
